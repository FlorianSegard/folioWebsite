                <h3>Data Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involved building a robust and resilient architecture using <strongDescr>Kafka streams</strongDescr>, a <strongDescr>data lake</strongDescr>, and <strongDescr>Spark</strongDescr> to ensure scalability.<br>
                    We utilized <strongDescr>Scala</strongDescr> as our programming language, emphasizing functional programming to ensure the purity of functions and achieve optimal <strongDescr>scalability</strongDescr> with Spark.<br>
                    The architecture was designed to handle the transmission of large volumes of small datas effectively.</p>

                    <h3>I - Description</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Situation:</strong> 
                        Come up with a startup idea of an innovative service based on:
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>IOT devices</li>
                            <li>An information system</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>IOT Devices:</strong> 
                        These devices must emit data every few minutes (or seconds). Assuming the startup is successful, 
                        there will be millions of these devices. We consider that you've managed to make a working prototype. 
                        Every data emitted by the devices must contain:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Timestamps</li>
                            <li>Device ID</li>
                            <li>Latitude and Longitude</li>
                            <li>Any other field you find useful (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Your Information System Must Provide:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An urgent service referred to as "alert"</li>
                            <li>A long-term analytics service</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Recommended System Architecture:</strong> 
                        Based on the preliminary questions, your solution is very likely to include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>At least one distributed storage</li>
                            <li>At least one distributed stream processing framework</li>
                            <li>At least two stream consumers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>II - Our solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our idea was to assess the danger posed by individuals and alert the police when necessary. We use a "dangerousity" index, a float ranging from 0 to 1. For testing the architecture, we simply generated a random number within this range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We implemented a <strongDescr>Kafka stream</strongDescr> with two <strongDescr>brokers</strongDescr>, each configured with 3 <strongDescr>partitions</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>replicates</strongDescr> across all <strongDescr>topics</strongDescr>. This setup ensured that even if a broker failed, the project would continue functioning without any data loss, demonstrating our project's scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were three sources of data, each representing drones, transmitting data every 0.1 seconds. All data were sent to a Kafka stream under the topic "drone-data."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A <strongDescr>consumer</strongDescr> named "Consumer Datalake" stores the data on the <strongDescr>Minio</strongDescr> datalake. Another consumer, "Consumer Alert," monitors the "dangerousity" index. If it exceeds 0.9, it forwards the data to the topic "high-danger-alerts."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, "Consumer AlertProcess" is tasked with triggering alerts via the Discord API to a Discord server when high danger alerts are received.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                <p>
                    We participated in two competitions: one involved creating a custom <strongDescr>Convolutional Neural Network</strongDescr> (CNN) using <strongDescr>TensorFlow</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>Keras</strongDescr>, and the other involved fine-tuning a model with PyTorch.<br>
                    Both competitions focused on classifying boat images sized 128x192 pixels into 10 different categories.

                    <h3>II - Hand made competiton</h3>
                    <p>
                        I tried copying different existing architecture like AlexNet or VGGNet, I also tried to build my own but it was not very concluent all this was done with keras <strongDescr>Tensorflow</strongDescr>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end I took the VGGNet and did some testing around it which alowed me to have a testing accuracy of <strongDescr>0.91141</strongDescr> on images we didn't had access to.
                        Alowing me to be in the <strongDescr>4th place</strongDescr> of the competition.

                    <h3>III - Fine Tuning competition</h3>
                    <p>
                        We tried fine tuning different models and the one that worked the best for this exercise was a version of pre trained densenet121 from <strongDescr>Pyrtorch</strongDescr>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And with testing we went up to <strongDescr>0.94891</strongDescr> on the images we didn't had access to.
                        Alowing me to be in the <strongDescr>1st place</strongDescr> of the competition.

                <p>
                    This project focused on processing a substantial amount of financial data in the most efficient manner possible, aiming for maximum speed without any loss of data.<br>
                    We developed a backend using <strongDescr>Pandas</strongDescr> to transfer data to the <strongDescr>PostgreSQL</strongDescr> database as effectively as possible.<br>
                    We then developped a <strongDescr>Dash</strongDescr> frontend to visualize the stored data.

                    <p>
                        <strong> 5 years of financial data</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work is done in two steps:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read the data, clean it, and store it intelligently in a database.</li>
                            <li>Create a dashboard that allows for visualization of the data and performing some analyses.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>II - Backend</h3>
                    <p>
                        The backend was the most substantial component of this project. It involved collecting, processing, and optimizing the data with <strongDescr>Pandas</strongDescr>, plus transferring it to the <strongDescr>PostgreSQL</strongDescr> database, which was challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After optimizing the code, the total processing time for all the data was approximately <strongDescr>one hour</strongDescr> to read the datas from <strongDescr>271325 files</strongDescr>, clean them and stock the datas, even on less efficient computers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One potential improvement to reduce processing time could be to implement multithreading. However, I encountered database issues and lacked sufficient time to address these.
                        Additionally, the project's high resource consumption with multithreading limited its compatibility across different computers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>III - Frontend</h3>
                    <p>
                        In our project, we've created a financial analytics dashboard using Dash in Python. The features we did were:

                            <li>Customizable date range selections for viewing stock data.</li>
                            <li>Multiple stock displays with individual color coding and an interactive legend for toggling visibility.</li>
                            <li>Bollinger Bands for analyzing stock volatility.</li>
                            <li>A data table showing daily stats like min, max, and average prices for selected stocks.</li>

                        <strong>"AI vs AI"</strong>: concerns the detection of texts emitted by a generative AI. This challenge takes place at <strongDescr>Albertschool</strongDescr> in Paris during three days.
                    </p>

                    <h3>II - Data cleaning and Pretreatment</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the data cleaning phase, we performed basic operations such as removing datas that were either NULL or not usable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsequently, we applied various tokenization methods and assessed their performance across different models, utilizing libraries such as <strongDescr>NLTK</strongDescr>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also reviewed all sources of the texts and identified that the dataset was constructed using more than 30 different AIs.<br>
                        With this knowledge, we adjusted the number of texts sourced from each AI based on their initial accuracy in our existing model.
                    </p>

                    <h3>II - Data cleaning and Pretreatment</h3>
                    <p>
                        We analyzed the dataset and then cleaned the data to ensure all entries were in English, eliminating any multilingual issues for training our models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We implemented different <strongDescr>Tokenization</strongDescr> processes using <strongDescr>NLTK</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>Tiktoken</strongDescr>,
                        which segment the text into smaller units. We also applied several <strongDescr>normalization</strongDescr> methods to simplify the text, such as converting to <strongDescr></strongDescr>lowercase, <strongDescr>removing punctuation</strongDescr>, <strongDescr>stopwords</strongDescr>, and <strongDescr>lemmatization</strongDescr>.

                    <p>
                        The project explores several models for the classification of music genres. <br>
                        <strongDescr>N-grams</strongDescr> use <strongDescr>trigrams</strongDescr> to generate new content, showing potential in capturing the lyrical styles of musical genres.<br> 
                        <strongDescr>Naive Bayes</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>Logistic Regression</strongDescr> are tested with different <strongDescr>Preprocessing</strongDescr> to examine their effectiveness in classification. 
                        Advanced approaches such as <strongDescr>TF-IDF</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>Word2Vec</strongDescr> are also implemented to enhance the capture of semantic relationships in the texts.<br>
                        <strongDescr>Neural Networks</strongDescr>, both <strongDescr>feedforward</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>recurrent</strongDescr>, are experimented with to assess their ability to handle the sequential data of lyrics. <br>
                        Each model is evaluated by its <strongDescr>Accuracy</strongDescr>, <strongDescr>Recall</strongDescr>, and <strongDescr>F1-score</strongDescr> to determine which method provides the best results for genre classification.

                    <p>
                        This project leveraged Microsoft Azure's cloud solutions, including <strongDescr>Computer Vision</strongDescr> and <strongDescr>Machine Learning</strongDescr>, to predict outcomes on two distinct datasets selected from Kaggle.<br>
                        We utilized a <strongDescr>breast cancer</strongDescr> dataset, employing images for the computer vision component and tabular data for the machine learning aspect.<br>

                    <p>
                        Utilize datasets of your choice to implement Computer Vision and Machine Learning using Microsoft Azure. <br>
                        To build a website for the cloud-based Machine Learning component, you must have access to an API provided by Microsoft Azure. <br>
                        For the Computer Vision component, you need to construct a Docker container to access its API.
                    </p>
                    <h3>II - Our solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        We used <strongDescr>Microsoft Azure</strongDescr> tools to train a <strongDescr>Computer Vision</strongDescr> model, which we then deployed locally using Docker <strongDescr>Docker</strongDescr>.<br>
                        Then, we employed <strongDescr>Machine Learning</strongDescr> capabilities to analyze tabular data.<br>
                        These combined technologies enabled us to identify various stages of cancer effectively with different data types.<br>
                        To integrate these components, we developed a streamlined <strongDescr>Flask</strongDescr> application.
